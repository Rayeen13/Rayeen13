## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Full-Stack .NET Developer from India who enjoys building systems that are **efficient, scalable, and meaningful**.

I care deeply about:

• performance and correctness  
• clean architecture & maintainability  
• developer experience & tooling  
• building technology that truly serves people  

Beyond coding, I think about **how software shapes society** and how we can build tools that empower rather than control.

A schema-first serialization format designed for high-performance structured data transport.

**Highlights:**
- ~78% payload reduction vs JSON in large datasets
- deterministic parsing & validation
- streaming-friendly design
- production-ready specification
